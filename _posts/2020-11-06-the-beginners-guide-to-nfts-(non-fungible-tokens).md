### So what are NFTs?  

<img src="{{site.url}}/images/cryptovoxels3.jpg" alt="Browsing on Cryptovoxels" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### Let's start with Bitcoin...  
Non-fungible tokens differ from cryptocurrencies (think Bitcoin) in a number of ways. Most explanations start with an understanding of the word 'fungible'. Bitcoin or fiat currency (money; not backed by gold) is fungible. These assets are mutually interchangeable which means one coin is essentially much like any other. The amount of that currency is essentially all that matters. It doesn't matter which particular crypto, coin or note you have as long as they equate in economic value.

### ...and move to Ethereum  
[ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) is an Ethereum protocol for things that work like money. ETH tokens are interchangeable (fungible). [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721), an interface protocol published in September 2017, is for non-fungible tokens. It's the most widely used protocol for Non-Fungible Tokens (though not the only one). NFTs... finally!  

The important point here that differentiates NFTs from money-like cryptocurrencies is that each NFT has a unique token ID. Non-Fungible Tokens are unique and this uniqueness is the main difference between NFTs and cryptocurrencies (which are mutually interchangeable).  

> ERC-20 tokens are fungible. This is the «money-like» standard.  
> ERC-721 tokens are non-fungible. This is the «things-like» standard.

### Some NFT History  
<img src="{{site.url}}/images/colored_coins.jpeg" alt="Some coloured coins" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Before the ERC-721 standard was introduced, there were other NFT protocols. In 2013 [a paper](http://bitpaper.info/serve/AMIfv94V0F8kxt1ACXga9Tc1V0jm-u-Jf2evCmcHWsZJmYSBG6JB5qA5E3J5eNToOSfOFs7LKfC6X8Y-_nUQR-C-qQC10aruJIVDG0ueU_qdZ4yG5l_VftKoBXs1xzpZHgCTx23tErQ1glKv0XrDC07gvNNINlM-QV1pWzdqhCM1MtubSUA7fyg.pdf) was written (with Vitalik Buterin among its authors) regarding so-called colored coins running on Bitcoin. This was an attempt at tracking a subset of Bitcoins on the network. The paper reads... 

> "they can open the way for the decentralized exchange of things that are not possible by traditional methods."

Tracking coloured coins didn't really work but the above quote suggests the NFT project in a nutshell.

[Counterparty](https://counterparty.io/) was a protocol that wrote code in the Bitcoin margins. It worked. [Spells of Genesis](https://spellsofgenesis.com/) was the first trading card game to run on Counterparty. It also introduced in-game assets to the blockchain. Regular trading-card game [Force of Will](http://www.fowtcg.com/) joined Spells of Genesis on the Counterparty blockchain in August 2016. The [Rare Pepe](https://rare-pepe.com/) meme began circulating on Counterparty and the market for these memes (as unique digital assets) surged.

<img src="{{site.url}}/images/rare_pepes_1.jpg" alt="Rare Pepes memes" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

[CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks) was next, written in and out of the margins of the ERC-20 Ethereum standard. The release of the ERC-721 protocol for trading unique, non-fungible tokens followed. ERC-721 works by tracking the history of transactions, thus verifying the uniqueness of each token. [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) was wildly successful on ERC-721, thereby bringing NFTs to popular attention.

### CryptoKitties  
<img src="{{site.url}}/images/cryptokitties2.jpeg" alt="CryptoKitties" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

[CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) is a game where you breed digital cats. Each cat brings a unique set of traits into the gene pool, if you like, and the aim of the game is to breed unique cats with a fabulous pedigree and (most probably) sell them. While it's pretty limited in terms of game-play it fits very well with the NFT protocol, the coding of 'genetic' traits emphasising individual differences and generating a (cat's) uniqueness, thus pretty nicely suited to the NFT format. A downside of the craze for CryptoKitties was the pressure it placed on the Ethereum blockchain and the corresponding increase in Ethereum gas fees.

### Trading of NFTs  
We've seen here some early examples of the most common forms of digital assets that are still traded today. The Rare Pepe memes and CryptoPunks could be classified as digital collectibles or digital art while digital trading cards and CryptoKitties are early examples of blockchain gaming. In the first half of 2020, gaming and collectibles made up [70% of NFT transactions by number](https://nonfungible.com/blog/nonfungible-first-semester-2020-segmented-performance-analysis). Digital art and virtual real estate have seen exceptional growth in recent times, together accounting for [70% of transactions by market volume (in USD)](https://nonfungible.com/blog/nonfungible-first-semester-2020-segmented-performance-analysis) for the same period.

### Virtual Worlds  
<img src="{{site.url}}/images/decentraland_1.jpg" alt="Flying cars in Decentraland" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

<img src="{{site.url}}/images/decentraland_2.jpg" alt="Swimming pool in Decentraland" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

[Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) is a virtual reality world. It raised $26 million with its [ICO in 2017](https://www.coindesk.com/26-million-blockchain-vr-project-decentraland-raises-new-funding-in-ico) and went live earlier this year. MANA is an ERC20 crypto token which is used to purchase LAND parcels in Decentraland. Once you have some LAND you can earn MANA by renting out space and charging for entry to events. [Cryptovoxels](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/) is a VR world where users often exhibit and sell digital art on the blockchain in virtual galleries. [The Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/en/), [MegaCryptoPolis](https://mcp3d.com/) and [Somnium Space](https://somniumspace.com/) are other VR worlds for which you can buy space on the blockchain if you have the crypto, but parcels of VR land don't come cheap! 

### Marketplaces  
[OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) prides itself as being 'the largest marketplace for rare items' and is a good place to develop your knowledge of NFT trade. It's a well presented website with clear, detailed and extensive [documentation](https://opensea.io/faq). Bestsellers are trading cards, digital collectibles and in-game assets (avatars, potions, level-ups etc) but you can also purchase virtual reality land, domain names and numerous other kinds of NFTs here. To buy and sell on OpenSea you need an Ethereum wallet (such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or similar).

<img src="{{site.url}}/images/open_sea_highest_price_trades.jpg" alt="Highest price trades on Open Sea.io" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

[Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/) is a hugely popular game which has 'adopted' the breeding concept from CryptoKitties and introduces some fighting alongside. [Gods Unchained](https://godsunchained.com/) and [Crypto Spells](https://en.cryptospells.jp/) are popular blockchain trading card games that retail on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). [My Crypto Heroes](https://www.mycryptoheroes.net/) is a virtual role-playing game from Japan that has been hugely popular in the Far East. Sports collectibles have taken off with [Sorare](https://sorare.com/) (fantasy football), [F1 Delta Time](https://www.f1deltatime.com/) (Formula One) and [MLB Champions](https://www.mlbcryptobaseball.com/) (baseball).

### Digital Art  
[Rarible](https://rarible.com/) and [SuperRare](https://superrare.co/) are important sites for trade of digital art and are already focusing on different customer bases. SuperRare appears to have established itself as the top-end showroom where digital art commands the highest prices. Rarible is more of a make your own and join in exchange, billed as the “community-owned NFT marketplace”. Creating your own digital art or collectible and selling (or storing) it on the blockchain, a process known as 'minting', is possible on marketplaces such as [Rarible](https://app.rarible.com/create/) and [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/blog/developers/how-to-create-your-own-marketplace-on-opensea-in-three-minutes-or-less/). Why not create your own range of collectibles?

<img src="{{site.url}}/images/super_rare_1.jpg" alt="SuperRare marketplace" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The NFT protocol may have much to offer the art world in terms of tracking the provenance of physical artworks. Christies recently [sold a blockchain-related artwork (including an NFT) for $130,000](https://fintechnews.ch/blockchain_bitcoin/christies-first-auction-of-blockchain-related-artwork-sold-for-more-than-us130000/39757/?). Digital art is more commonly traded on the blockchain. Owners can house and showcase collections of digital art in virtual reality art galleries which you can have a look around on sites such as [Cryptovoxels](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/). [Async Art](https://async.art/) is a leading company in what it calls 'programmable art,' ostensibly where owners have cryptographic access to the code to affect aspects of the art's presentation.

### Beyond...  
2020 has seen growth and expansion in the NFT market after a slightly muted 2019. Real world assets are increasingly being represented by non-fungible tokens. In 2017 a [$60,000 flat in Kiev was sold on the blockchain](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23631474-500-a-house-has-been-bought-on-the-blockchain-for-the-first-time/) while [properties have been tokenised in New York](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/realestate/a-blockchain-building-in-bushwick.html) (the non-fungible tokens here representing shares in a building).

With the release of the [ERC-1155 Multi-Token Standard protocol](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) in 2019, enabling the pooling of non-fungible (ERC-721) and fungible (ERC-20) assets, fractional tokenisation is now a possibility, potentially enabling people to own shares in assets. NFTs can provide proof of ownership, provenance and authenticy, concepts that are of crucial importance to many blockchain-based projects focused upon digital identity and data ownership.

Perhaps the awkward appellation 'Non-Fungible Tokens' won't last but this is an exciting and fast-developing sector of blockchain technology for crypto traders, artists and developers alike.
